Hello ,
i hope you are doing good .

Now we start.

you need to clone this repository.

there are two folder backend and fronend.

I created this backend using node.js, express.js, jsonwebtoken, mongodb atlas, mongoose, bcrypt, cors and more
create .env file in root of backend and add MONGODB_URI ,
JWT_SECRET ,
PORT,
if you want to use of mine (
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://ak26122k:ak26122k@cluster0.ahmum.mongodb.net/dashboard
JWT_SECRET=secret_token
PORT=5000
) ,
for start server first "npm install", then "npm start" or "npm run dev",

now in frontend go to frontend folder and create same .env file in frontend root and add VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000 , i created this frontend using react+vite, tailwind ,chart.js, axios, context.api, react-hot-toast, react-icons,javascript now for starting website using "npm run dev"
